   Final 5 Sections with 20 Questions

1️⃣ Phonological Awareness & Pronunciation (30%)
  Purpose: Tests the ability to hear, recognize, and manipulate sounds in words. Dyslexic children struggle with phonemic segmentation, blending, and rhyming.
     Scientific Basis: Phonological deficits are one of the strongest predictors of dyslexia.

   1️⃣ Rhyme Recognition: Which word rhymes with "cat"? (Options: Hat, Sun, Dog)
   2️⃣ Sound Segmentation: What are the sounds in "fish"? (Answer: /f/-/i/-/sh/)
   3️⃣ Blending Test: What word do these sounds make? /c/-/a/-/t/ → (Correct Answer: "Cat")
   4️⃣ Minimal Pairs (Auditory Discrimination): Do "bat" and "pat" sound the same or different?
   5️⃣ Syllable Counting: Clap the number of syllables in "elephant". (Options: 1, 2, 3)
   ✔ Adaptive Test: If the child struggles here, more phonological tasks are given before moving to words/sentences.


2️⃣ Rapid Naming & Processing Speed (20%)
 Purpose: Measures how quickly a child can name familiar objects, colors, or letters. Slow naming speed is a known dyslexia marker.
 Scientific Basis: Research links Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) speed with dyslexia.

 6️⃣ Color Naming Test: Name these colors as fast as possible: 🟥 🟦 🟩 🟨
 7️⃣ Object Naming Test: Name these objects quickly (Tree, Ball, Sun, Book)
 8️⃣ Letter Naming Speed: Read these letters as fast as possible: m, d, b, q, p
 9️⃣ Number Naming Test: Read these numbers: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5
 ✔ Adaptive Test: If slow, more time-sensitive tasks are given before moving to reading.


3️⃣ Letter & Word Recognition (20%)
  Purpose: Tests the ability to recognize letters and differentiate similar-looking ones (common in dyslexia).
  Scientific Basis: Studies show dyslexic kids confuse mirror-image letters (b/d, p/q, n/u).
 🔟 Letter Confusion Test: Point to the correct letter: (b, d, p, q)
 1️⃣1️⃣ Word Matching: Which word matches this? ("DOG" or "DGO")
 1️⃣2️⃣ Error Spotting: What's wrong in this word? ("Trane" instead of "Train")
 1️⃣3️⃣ Sight Word Recognition: Which is a real word? (House, Housr)
 ✔ Adaptive Test: If struggling, more letter-based tasks before moving to full words.


4️⃣ Working Memory & Sequencing (15%)
  Purpose: Tests short-term memory & ability to recall sequences—critical for reading.
  Scientific Basis: Dyslexia affects verbal working memory and number recall.
 1️⃣4️⃣ Digit Span Backwards: Repeat these numbers backward: "3, 9, 4" → (Answer: "4, 9, 3")
 1️⃣5️⃣ Pattern Completion: What comes next? (A, B, A, B, ?)
 1️⃣6️⃣ Story Recall: Read this sentence: "The dog ran fast." → What did the dog do?
 ✔ Adaptive Test: If the child struggles, we increase short-memory tasks before reading tests.


5️⃣ Writing & Motor Skills (15%)
  Purpose: Tests handwriting, copying skills, and fine motor coordination.
  Scientific Basis: Many dyslexic children also have dysgraphia (writing difficulty).
 1️⃣7️⃣ Copy a shape: Can you draw this? (Simple triangle, square)
 1️⃣8️⃣ Write your name: Ask the child to write their own name.
 1️⃣9️⃣ Sentence Dictation: "Write 'The sun is big.'"
 2️⃣0️⃣ Handwriting Analysis: Can the child space letters properly in "Big dog runs fast"?
 ✔ Adaptive Test: If handwriting issues appear, suggest motor skill exercises before language tests.
